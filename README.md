# 🍽️ Food Processing Quality Analytics  
### End-to-End Data Science & Predictive Analytics Project

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository presents a **production-style, end-to-end Data Science project**
focused on **Food Processing Quality, Safety, and Shelf-Life Analytics**.

The project is designed to simulate **real-world industry workflows** used in
food manufacturing and processing organizations, with emphasis on:
- Quality consistency
- Safety & regulatory alignment
- Data-driven operational decision-making

The work follows a **structured 6-week analytics lifecycle**, from raw data
understanding to predictive modeling and strategic documentation.

## 🧩 Business Problem
Food processing organizations commonly face:
- High product wastage due to inaccurate shelf-life estimates  
- Inconsistent quality across production batches  
- Limited predictive insight into quality degradation drivers  
- Reactive quality control instead of proactive risk prevention  

This project addresses these challenges by building a **data-driven analytical
framework** to understand, predict, and monitor food quality outcomes.

## 🔬 Analytical Approach
The project follows a **hypothesis-driven and evaluation-first methodology**:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Data distribution analysis  
   - Trend & anomaly detection  
   - Early risk identification  

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Missing value treatment  
   - Outlier handling with domain logic  
   - Consistency and validation checks  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Process, environmental, and supplier-level features  
   - Interaction and stability indicators  

4. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Regression-based shelf-life prediction  
   - Tree-based and ensemble models for non-linear behavior  
   - Hypothesis testing through model interpretability  

5. **Model Evaluation & Risk Assessment**  
   - Cross-validation and temporal validation  
   - Error impact and risk-aware evaluation  
   - Business-aligned performance interpretation

## 📊 Key Outcomes (Analytical / Simulated)
- Established a structured, reproducible analytics workflow  
- Identified critical drivers influencing food quality and shelf-life  
- Developed predictive models to support **proactive quality decisions**  
- Designed an evaluation framework aligned with **food safety risk sensitivity**  
- Created audit-ready documentation suitable for regulatory and business review  

> *Note: Outcomes are analytical and educational in nature, designed to reflect
industry practices without using proprietary production data.*
